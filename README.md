# Frontend Mentor - Invoice App

This is a solution to the [Invoice app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl). I used this challenge as a mockup and implemented few own ideas.

## Overview

### Description

I took the challenge solely to see how to work with Firebase. After checking it out, I much prefer MongoDB.

The application lacks proper design, compatible with Figma. I didn't focus on 100% reproduction of the mockup, as that was not my goal.

Similarly, the code itself definitely needs a refactoring, but I have no intention of developing this project, so I leave it as is.

Of the things that are badly resolved, there is definitely wrong state holding, no loading, lack of toasts, and an application architecture that is not fully thought out.
